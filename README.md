# Phoenix Framework

Phoenix is a mini RESTful MVC framework on top of php-rack inspired by [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

php-rack was developed by [Jim Myhrberg](https://github.com/jimeh) and is currently maintained by [Ted Kulp](https://github.com/tedkulp)

## Features

* Simple MVC architecture
* RESTful HTTP routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Built on a library similar to [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) for easy 
  middleware-based expandability
* Error handling
* Supports PHP 5+

### Coming soon

* Hability to integrate with ORM classes like [Idiorm](https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm) or [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
* Some kind of extension system
* Integration with template engines like [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org/) or [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
* Unit testing w/ [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/)
* Set development mode to show error details
* Flash messaging
* Caching system
* Logging system
* Command line system to generate controllers/views and models
